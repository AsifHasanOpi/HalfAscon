**HalfAscon: Lightweight Authenticated Encryption**

HalfAscon is a lightweight authenticated encryption algorithm based on the ASCON cipher. It retains the security features of ASCON while reducing the block size to 64 bits, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Features

	64-bit block size
	Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) 
	Lightweight and efficient 
	Suitable for resource-constrained devices 
	Provides data integrity and confidentiality
