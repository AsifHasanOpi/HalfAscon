**HalfAscon: Lightweight Authenticated Encryption**

HalfAscon is a lightweight authenticated encryption algorithm based on the ASCON cipher. It retains the security features of ASCON while reducing the block size to 64 bits, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. This repository provides the reference implementation of HalfAscon and detailed information for developers and security researchers.

Features
			64-bit block size
			Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
			Lightweight and efficient
			Suitable for resource-constrained devices
			Provides data integrity and confidentiality
